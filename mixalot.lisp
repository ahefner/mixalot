;;; Another reasonable design would be that you connect a single
;;; stream to the audio device, and a mixer is just another type of
;;; stream. This would solve some problems for a certain kind of app,
;;; but I haven't pursued simply because I didn't think of it soon
;;; enough, and changing to that approach if/when I have use for it
;;; shouldn't break the API incompatibly.
